        <h1>Will's Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my simple personal website!</p>
        <p>I originally considered using a Hugo template page for static site generation, but I decided to start directly from basics and work my way up. For now you'll just see basic HTML and maybe some CSS when I get around to it. It also just felt like overkill for some simple posts for now.</p>
